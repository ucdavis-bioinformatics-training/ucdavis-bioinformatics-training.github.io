The Bioinformatics Core is excited to be offering more courses than ever before in 2020, and committed to keeping all our students safe during the coronavirus outbreak. As the situation changes, we will update our schedule on the [Genome Center Event Registration](https://registration.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/) site. While we find ways to continue supporting bioinformatics education, we hope you will make use of our online materials. All resources and course materials from our past courses are publicly available here.
